## Smart Portfolio Assistant

This is a **smart portfolio** created by me. It features an **interactive chat experience** where recruiters and visitors can:

- Ask questions about my **resume**, experience, and skills  
- Get guided through my projects and achievements  
- Learn more about me through a dedicated **About** page  

The goal of this project is to make my profile more engaging and conversational, so recruiters can quickly understand who I am and what I’ve worked on.

### Tech Stack

- **Vite** + **React** + **TypeScript**
- **Tailwind CSS** + **shadcn-ui** for modern UI components
- **Supabase** for backend integrations and chat-related functionality

### Purpose

This project is designed specifically for **recruiters** and **hiring managers** to explore my background in an intuitive, conversational way, instead of just reading a static resume.
